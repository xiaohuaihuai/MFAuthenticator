> MFAuthenticator generates 2-Step Verification codes in your Mini Program.

## MFAuthenticator

MFAuthenticator is a two-factor authentication application for systems
utilizing one-time password protocols. Tokens can be added easily by scanning a QR code.

MFAuthenticator implements open standards:

* HOTP (HMAC-Based One-Time Password Algorithm) [RFC 4226](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4226.txt)
* TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password Algorithm) [RFC 6238](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6238.txt)

This means that no proprietary server-side component is necessary: use any server-side component
that implements these standards.
